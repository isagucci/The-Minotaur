    <p>We see the two of them again.</p>
    <p>Theseus remembers his place and his danger.</p>
    <p>He takes a piece of cord (perhaps this is the source of the myth of the string) and he binds the Minotaur quickly, before she understands.</p>
    <p>We walk with them.</p>
    <p>She is calm.</p>
    <p>His haste in tying her was not needed.</p>
    <p>She would not have fought.</p>
    <p>Even bound, she is changed.</p>
    <p>She is searching her memory for something, something from before, something from outside these corridors whose every groove and branch she knows.</p>
    <p>We follow, turning every familiar corner, past every fountain and brick wall, known by touch to one, to the other known through the study of maps.</p>
    <p>We come to the familiar door at the top of the labyrinth, the door we both know, but have neither passed.</p>
    <p>We pass through this door now, beyond the walls of the labyrinth.</p>
    <p>It is here that Theseus leaves me, here that I repeat my story.</p>
    <p>Still blind, I cannot move from this place.</p>
    <p>There are no walls around me, and I am lost.</p>
