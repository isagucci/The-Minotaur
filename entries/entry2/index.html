	The first thing that must be said is that the Minotaur was blind. Her mother — for the Minotaur, actually, was a woman — torn with guilt for her own sins, blinded the Minotaur soon after her birth. She could not bear to see the eyes of her child staring at her from the face of a bull. She blinded her, and then she placed her in the midst of the labyrinth, of which you have probably heard.
<br>
<br>

The Minotaur grew up in the labyrinth with no knowledge of any other living thing. As she grew she learned the windings of the labyrinth, learned the places where food was left for her, where water continually flowed, where the sun shone down warmly (for the labyrinth was not fully underground), and where there were soft warm spots for sleeping. Though she was blind, she learned to move through the labyrinth quickly and surely, following it with her hands and feet and even by smell. The walls and turnings acted as familiar guides, allowing her to move freely where others quickly became lost. In this way the Minotaur grew peacefully, knowing nothing of herself or others. When her mother’s servants left food, they were careful to move silently and avoid her touch because they could see she was a monster, and they were afraid.
<br>
<br>
A change came on the day when the Minotaur first touched another human being. The poor servant was tired, and had lain down to rest under some trees in the labyrinth. The Minotaur stumbled upon him, and he woke up. When he opened his eyes and saw the monster bending over him, he screamed, struck out, and tried to get away. But he was not so lucky. The Minotaur, moving by reflex, struck back. And being filled with the power of her father the bull, she killed the servant with a single blow. She felt his blood on her hands, and thought of the waters she drank. She tasted it, and remembered the taste of some of the foods she had eaten.
<br>
<br>
This was the beginning of the second stage of the Minotaur’s life, the stage for which she is most famous. She learned the smell of humans, and learned to listen quietly for their steps. She had smelled them before, when they brought her food, but she had always thought the smell was the food itself. Now she knew that the smell came from the bodies of the servants, from a different kind of food. She caught them whenever she could, and feasted upon them. She knew every place to hide, and how to walk through the labyrinth silently, and so she was a good hunter.
Her mother and the king quickly learned what had begun. The queen was sorrier than ever for the birth of her child, now that it had truly proven to be a monster. The servants became more careful. After the first few, they were rarely caught by the Minotaur, who still fed mostly on the dishes prepared by her mother’s cooks.
