We then see Theseus forget his fears (for even he had some). He forgets he has no sword (for the stories lie there, also). He forgets that this thing before him has killed many men. And he approaches. We see him softly crouch next to the Minotaur, ready to run. He touches her cheek, the cheek of a bull, and he touches the breast of a woman. She stirs and turns her face toward him, reaching out slowly.

<br>
Perhaps you will wonder now why the Minotaur did not simply awaken and strike Theseus, killing him as she easily could have done. It was for this reason: the Minotaur had never been touched, and she didnâ€™t know what this thing was that touched her. In all her years, she had always been the first to catch her prey, and as she caught them they fought and cried and struck. 

<br>
She killed and ate them in this frenzy, never having felt their human hands upon her, never having heard their human voices. Now that she was being touched by two such hands, hands filled with the memories of a lover, she did not remember the fighting and killing of struggling beasts. She did not remember that she had gone without food the previous day. Rather, she almost remembers the touch of her mother on those few days before her blinding and her placement in the labyrinth.
<br>
We see the two of them again. Theseus remembers his place and his danger. He takes a piece of cord (perhaps this is the source of the myth of the string) and he binds the Minotaur quickly, before she understands. We walk with them. She is calm. His haste in tying her was not needed. She would not have fought. Even bound, she is changed. She is searching her memory for something, something from before, something from outside these corridors whose every groove and branch she knows. 
<br>
We follow, turning every familiar corner, past every fountain and brick wall, known by touch to one, to the other known through the study of maps. We come to the familiar door at the top of the labyrinth, the door we both know, but have neither passed.
We pass through this door now, beyond the walls of the labyrinth. It is here that Theseus leaves me, here that I repeat my story. Still blind, I cannot move from this place. There are no walls around me, and I am lost.
