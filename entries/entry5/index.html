The story changes again with the arrival of Theseus. We remember from other tales that he slew the Minotaur, but this is not what actually happened. He did come to Crete and befriend the daughter of the king and queen. And it was this daughter who warned him about the Minotaur. But she gave him maps, not a string, to help him find his way out of the labyrinth. The rest of the story was also quite different from what is usually told. 
</p>

 <div class="line"></div>
 <div class="l3"></div>
<p class="t2">
We see Theseus thrust into the labyrinth, the door shut behind him. We see him walking slowly through the corridors, informed of the turns and rooms. He knows where he can drink, and so he does not grow thirsty. He knows where to find the door out, and so he does not grow afraid. He knows the resting places of the Minotaur, and knows to listen for her footsteps, so he is not surprised.
</p> 
 <div class="l4"></div>
<p class="t3">
We watch him walking slowly, softly, until he comes to a small glade in the center of the labyrinth. And here he has some luck, for the Minotaur is asleep in the glade, lulled by a warm summer sun. When Theseus looks at the Minotaur he is shocked, because he does not see a monster.
</p> 

<div class="l5"></div>
<p class="t4">
He does, of course, see a beast with the head of a bull, a beast deformed by years of eating human flesh. But he also sees his lover, the woman who gave him the key to the labyrinth. He sees the body and the soul of his lover reflected in her half-sister, as he looks upon her scarred eyes.
</p> 
<div class="l6"></div>
<p class="t5">
We then see Theseus forget his fears (for even he had some). He forgets he has no sword (for the stories lie there, also). He forgets that this thing before him has killed many men. And he approaches. We see him softly crouch next to the Minotaur, ready to run.

She stirs and turns her face toward him, reaching out slowly.
Perhaps you will wonder now why the Minotaur did not simply awaken and strike Theseus, killing him as she easily could have done. 
<br>
<br>
It was for this reason: the Minotaur had never been touched, and she didn’t know what this thing was that touched her.
<br>
<br>
In all her years, she had always been the first to catch her prey, and as she caught them they fought and cried and struck. She killed and ate them in this frenzy, never having felt their human hands upon her, never having heard their human voices. 
<br>
<br>
Now that she was being touched by two such hands, hands filled with the memories of a lover, she did not remember the fighting and killing of struggling beasts. She did not remember that she had gone without food the previous day. Rather, she almost remembers the touch of her mother on those few days before her blinding and her placement in the labyrinth.
