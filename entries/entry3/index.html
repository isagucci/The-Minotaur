	It was not long, however, before the king realized how he could make use of his stepdaughter. He began sending prisoners into the labyrinth. At first servants carefully followed, to make sure the Minotaur did her work. But after five or six easy successes they realized that such watching was not necessary. The prisoners, unfamiliar with the labyrinth, quickly lost their way and grew tired. The Minotaur had acquired a taste for human flesh. She preferred it to cooked food, and she quickly dispatched anyone she came upon. As an added precaution the king began leaving her without food for a day before sending anyone down. The Minotaur quickly learned what this day without food meant, learned to move carefully through a hunt on the day following. In this way the king and the Minotaur entered into a dark partnership, which continued for many years.

The story changes again with the arrival of Theseus. We remember from other tales that he slew the Minotaur, but this is not what actually happened. He did come to Crete and befriend the daughter of the king and queen. And it was this daughter who warned him about the Minotaur. But she gave him maps, not a string, to help him find his way out of the labyrinth. The rest of the story was also quite different from what is usually told.
<br>
<br>
We see Theseus thrust into the labyrinth, the door shut behind him. We see him walking slowly through the corridors, informed of the turns and rooms. He knows where he can drink, and so he does not grow thirsty. He knows where to find the door out, and so he does not grow afraid. He knows the resting places of the Minotaur, and knows to listen for her footsteps, so he is not surprised.
