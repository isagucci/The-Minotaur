A change came on the day when the Minotaur first touched another human being. The poor servant was tired, and had lain down to rest under some trees in the labyrinth. The Minotaur stumbled upon him, and he woke up. When he opened his eyes and saw the monster bending over him, he screamed, struck out, and tried to get away. But he was not so lucky. The Minotaur, moving by reflex, struck back. And being filled with the power of her father the bull, she killed the servant with a single blow. She felt his blood on her hands, and thought of the waters she drank. She tasted it, and remembered the taste of some of the foods she had eaten.

This was the beginning of the second stage of the Minotaur’s life, the stage for which she is most famous. She learned the smell of humans, and learned to listen quietly for their steps. She had smelled them before, when they brought her food, but she had always thought the smell was the food itself. Now she knew that the smell came from the bodies of the servants, from a different kind of food. She caught them whenever she could, and feasted upon them. She knew every place to hide, and how to walk through the labyrinth silently, and so she was a good hunter.
Her mother and the king quickly learned what had begun. The queen was sorrier than ever for the birth of her child, now that it had truly proven to be a monster. The servants became more careful. After the first few, they were rarely caught by the Minotaur, who still fed mostly on the dishes prepared by her mother’s cooks.

It was not long, however, before the king realized how he could make use of his stepdaughter. He began sending prisoners into the labyrinth. At first servants carefully followed, to make sure the Minotaur did her work. But after five or six easy successes they realized that such watching was not necessary. The prisoners, unfamiliar with the labyrinth, quickly lost their way and grew tired. The Minotaur had acquired a taste for human flesh. She preferred it to cooked food, and she quickly dispatched anyone she came upon. As an added precaution the king began leaving her without food for a day before sending anyone down. The Minotaur quickly learned what this day without food meant, learned to move carefully through a hunt on the day following. In this way the king and the Minotaur entered into a dark partnership, which continued for many years.
