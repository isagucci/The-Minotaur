	<h2>We watch him walking slowly, softly, until he comes to a small glade in the center of the labyrinth. And here he has some luck, for the Minotaur is asleep in the glade, lulled by a warm summer sun. When Theseus looks at the Minotaur he is shocked, because he does not see a monster. He does, of course, see a beast with the head of a bull, a beast deformed by years of eating human flesh. But he also sees his lover, the woman who gave him the key to the labyrinth. He sees the body and the soul of his lover reflected in her half-sister, as he looks upon her scarred eyes.
