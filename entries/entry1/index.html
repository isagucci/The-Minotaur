	<h2>In traditional Greek mythology, when King Minos of Crete failed to sacrifice a bull to Poseidon, the god caused his wife to lust 
	after the animal. By it, she conceived the Minotaur, a monster with a bull’s head and a man’s body, which was confined in a labyrinth. There, it devoured human beings, until it was killed by Theseus.
